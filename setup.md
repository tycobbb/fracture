# Setup

Unfortunately, I am not able to get the project to build on a fresh machine in its current state. I suspect this is due to many
of its build dependencies (LibGDX, Gradle, Kotlin Runtime) being severely out of date, as this project is 3 years old.  

If you already have Android Studio or IntelliJ CE installed, you may be able to clone the project, create a run configuration 
for the `DesktopLauncher` main class, and run the game. Unfortunately, in order to provide a more replicable development setup
or build a distributable version of the game, I think I would need to upgrade its dependencies and work through any breaking 
changes.
